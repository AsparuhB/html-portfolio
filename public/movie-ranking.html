<h1>The Best Movies According to Asparuh</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Avengers "Infinity War"</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite movies of all time<br />
as it summarizes the MCU's "Phase 3". Sadly<br />
it can't be watched without watching the other<br />
MCU movies prior.</p>

<h3>Avengers "Endgame"</h3>
<p>This is my MOST favorite movie of all all-time<br />
The ending of 22 movies and 11 years of build up.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Amazing movie. Must watch!</p>
